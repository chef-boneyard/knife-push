The knife push plugin is used by the Chef workstation to interact with the Push API to start jobs, view job status, view job lists, and view node status.

## Requirements

- Chef 15.0 higher
- Ruby 2.5 or higher

## Installation

This plugin ships built into Chef Workstation. Install Chef Workstation to use the plugin.

## Configuration

If push server is running on the same host as the Chef Server, then no reconfiguration is required on the Chef workstation.

## Subcommands

This plugin provides the following Knife subcommands. Specific command options can be found by invoking the subcommand with a `--help` flag.

### job list

The `job list` subcommand is used to view a list of Push jobs.

#### Syntax $ knife job list

### job start

The `job start` subcommand is used to start a Push job.

#### Syntax

```shell
knife job start (options) COMMAND [NODE, NODE, ...]
```

#### Options

This argument has the following options:

`--timeout TIMEOUT`

The maximum amount of time (in seconds) by which a job must complete, before it will be stopped.

`-q QUORUM --quorum QUORUM`

The minimum number of nodes that match the search criteria, are available, and acknowledge the job request. This can be expressed as a percentage (e.g. 50%) or as an absolute number of nodes (e.g. 145). Default value: 100%

`-b --nowait`

Exit immediately after starting a job instead of waiting for it to complete.

`--with-env ENVIRONMENT`

Accept a json blob of environment variables and use those to set the variables for the client. For example '{"test": "foo"}' will set the push client environment variable "test" to "foo". (Push 2.0 and later)

`--in-dir DIR`

Execute the remote command in the directory DIR. (Push 2.0 and later)

`--file DATAFILE`

Send the file to the client. (Push 2.0 and later)

`--capture`

Capture stdin and stdout for this job. (Push 2.0 and later)

#### Examples

For example, to search for nodes assigned the role "webapp", and where 90% of those nodes must be available, enter:

```shell
knife job start -quorum 90% 'chef-client' --search 'role:webapp'
```

To search for a specific set of nodes (named chico, harpo, groucho, gummo, zeppo), and where 90% of those nodes must be available, enter:

```shell
knife job start --quorum 90% 'chef-client' chico harpo groucho gummo zeppo
```

Use the `knife job start` subcommand to run a job with the following syntax:

```shell
knife job start job_name node_name
```

For example, to run a job named add-glasses against a node named "ricardosalazar", enter the following:

```shell
knife job start add-glasses 'ricardosalazar'
```

### job output

The `job output` command is used to view the output of Push jobs. (Push 2.0 and later). The output capture flag must have been set on job start; see the --capture option.

#### Syntax

```shell
knife job output JOBID NODENAME1 NODENAME2
```

```shell
knife job output JOBID -s SEARCH_QUERY
```

#### Examples

```shell
knife job output 26e98ba162fa7ba6fb2793125553c7ae test --channel stdout
```

```shell
knife job output 26e98ba162fa7ba6fb2793125553c7ae -s "policy_group:staging" --channel stdout
```

#### Options

--channel [stderr|stdout]

The output channel to capture.

--search QUERY

Solr query for list of nodes that can have job output.

### job status

The `job status` command is used to view the status of Push jobs.

#### Syntax

```shell
knife job status JOBID
```

#### Examples

For example, to view the status of a job that has the identifier of "235", enter:

```shell
knife job status 235
```

### node status

The `node status` argument is used to identify nodes that Push may interact with.

#### Syntax

```shell
knife node status
```
